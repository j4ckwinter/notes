# Statement context

As with expressions, statements can refer only to what's in the statement context such as an event handling method of 
the component instance.

Angular evaluates all expressions in double curly braces, converts the expression results to strings, and links them 
with neighboring literal strings. Finally, it assigns this composite interpolated result to an element or directive 
property.
