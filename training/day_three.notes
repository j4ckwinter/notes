Property & Event Binding:
We can bind to - HTML Elements, Directives, Componenents

EventEmitter allows to emit our own events. Eg tell a parent component when something
has been done. 
new EventEmitter<{}>();
Brackets to call the constructor
event.emit({pass the object})
We can then use @Output to pass out of the component
