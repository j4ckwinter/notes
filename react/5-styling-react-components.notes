#Styling React Components

#CSS Modules
CSS Modules are a relatively new concept (you can dive super-deep into them here: 
https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). With CSS modules, you can write normal CSS code and make sure, that it only 
applies to a given component.

Example:
In Post.css File: 
[css]
.Post {
    color: red;
}
[end]
In Post Component File: 
[javascript]
import classes from './Post.css';
 
const post = () => (
    <div className={classes.Post}>...</div>
);
[end]
