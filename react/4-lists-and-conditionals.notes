#Working With Lists and Conditionals

#Rendering Content Conditionally
In our render method we can wrap our JSX content in a { this.state.showPersons === true ? <div></div>} : null if we only 
want to show persons given our state is true. Our else case is defined by the colon.
This is another use of us injecting javascript expressions into JSX using curly brackets. Effectively we are calling
React.createElement(), not explicitly but this is what React is doing under the hood.
